# IDAES User Interface Documentation

This documentation describes user interfaces (UIs) for the
<a href="https://idaes.org" target="_blank">Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES)</a>
Integrated Platform, which are distributed through the [idaes-pse](https://pypi.org/project/idaes-pse/)
package on PyPI.

This documentation is divided into two main sections

[User Documentation](#user-documentation)
: For those who wish to use the UIs, including IDAES and other model developers who are using, e.g., the Flowsheet Visualizer UI for debugging.

[Developer Documentation](#developer-documentation)
: For those who wish to change, add to, or extend the IDAES UIs by changing the UI code itself.
