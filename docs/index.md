# IDAES UI

The Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP) consists of high-level capabilities that solve complex design and optimization problems with the core IDAES software framework, which makes use of state of the art equation-oriented optimization  solvers. For more details on these components, see the [IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

This documentation is for *user interface* components that build on top of the IDAES core Python library and applications. This documentation is for all users; additional information relevant for software developers of the IDAES platform will be prefixed with "ðŸ’»Developers".

Sections:

* [Getting started](#getting-started) - Install the software
* [Flowsheet Visualizer](#fv) - Visualize flowsheet layout and properties.

## Getting Started

The IDAES UI components are distributed as a Python package using the Conda package management system from [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com). They are normally installed with the IDAES software. For details, see the [IDAES installation instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started/index.html). 

ðŸ’»Developers: To install the UI components from GitHub, follow the procedures outlined in the IDAES-IP [Advanced User Installation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/advanced_install/index.html) section to set up your environment. Then you should fork and clone the [idaes/idaes-ui](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-ui.git) repository and install it with: `pip install -e .`

## Flowsheet Visualizer

The IDAES-IP [Flowsheet Visualizer](#flowsheet-visualizer) (FV) is a graphical user interface that displays complex *flowsheets* (connected components representing a system or sub-system to be optimized) created with the IDAES-IP Python core software. The FV uses web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) so is cross-platform and has identical functionality on computers running Windows, Mac, and UNIX.

**FV Sections:** [Tutorials](#fv-tutorials) | [How-to](#fv-howto) | [Reference](#fv-reference)

### Tutorials

#### Example flowsheet

A simple example flowsheet is included and can be viewed with:

 `python -m idaes_ui.fv.example`

This will open the system's default web browser to show the flowsheet and its controls.
