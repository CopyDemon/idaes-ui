# Installation

Below are installation instructions for installing IDAES UIs.
More details on overall IDAES installation and usage 
are on the [IDAES documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) site.

If you want to use the UIs (not develop new code),
then use `pip` to install the software as part of the 
IDAES Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP).

```shell
pip install "idaes-pse[ui]"
```
