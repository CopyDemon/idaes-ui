## Flowsheet Visualizer

The flowsheet visualizer  is a web-based user interface (UI). Features include:

* View any IDAES flowsheet as a process engineering diagram
* Rearrange the flowsheet diagram to your taste and save the arrangement for next time
* Export flowsheet diagrams as images
* View and export the "stream table" for the flowsheet
* Dynamically refresh the displayed values to reflect changes in the underlying IDAES model
